<h1>RACE CATEGORIES</h1>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The MADathon (Making A  Difference marathon) 2015 will host 3 race categories – The half marathon (21.1 Km), 
the 10K run (10 Km) and 5K run for children and women. All 3 events have the same registration fee and all 
runners will be given a running T-shirt, running bib (NO timing chip), finisher’s medal and a refreshment box.
</p>
<h4>HALF MARATHON (21.1 KM)</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For runners with 10K experience this is a race to hit the 20K plus mark before running a full marathon. 
The Half Marathon event is happening for the first time in MADathon. 
</p>
<h4>10K (10 KM)</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The ever popular 10K event was a runaway success in 2014 attracting 300 runners in MADathon’s first edition.
 This year the 10K run will be for a different cause. If you are a regular short distance runner, this should 
 be your go for MADathon 2015.
 </p>
<h4>5K (5 KM)</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Making A Difference does not require you to be a professional long distance runner. You can run a 5K event
 and still support the cause. This event is only for women and Children.

	<!-- <ul>
	<li>Running, a totally underrated word, is way more than what people think it is. It's a passion,

an expression. It's a way of life.</li><br>

<li>Running, as we runners define in our dictionary is something that portrays our character, our

hard work and dedication, rather than just the lay-man term of the physical exercise every

morning.</li><br>

<li>The day was pleasant, peaceful and full of tranquillity. The runners were full of spirits and

loved the environment. The event started with great enthusiasm as the runners took deep

breaths as the clocked ticked to the perfect time to start.</li><br>




<li>Sanobar Sultana, invited as the Guest of Honour along with Mr.Neville Bilimoria (Marathon

Runner,Rower,Cyclist and also the Brand Ambassador for MADathon), Dr.M.Ravi (IG

Chennai Police), Mr.Venkatraman Venkatadhr (Founder "I Cycle to Work Initiative" ) and

Mr.Ram Kumar (Director Of Finance Ashok Leyland) @ MADathon (Making A Difference

marathon) gave their words of encouragement and whole-heartedly supported the event,

organised to spread awareness of child rights and welfare of the underprivileged children.<br>

The 10km run started at the tick of 6 in the morning, the sun rising and bringing its rays of

energy and calmness towards us. The environment surrounding the beach,

the weather being just perfect, gave everyone the strength  needed to run all the way.</li><br>

<li>There were 12 hydration points, each perfectly placed for the runner's benefits. At the

mark of reaching 7.5kms, everyone received the big boost critically needed. The moment everyone

saw Mr.Neville Bilimoria going the other way, his quick smile towards everyone truly boosted up

the spirits and they were able to complete the run with amazing grace.</li><br>

<li>The MADathon not only had a 10km run, but alsoa 5km one which was flagged off at 6:45am and

a 3km for younger kids flagged off at 7am.The kids who ran today were all given medals at the finish line.

At the end, the runners had a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction which further

extended to even the organisers of the successful MADathon.</li> 
<li> It is very difficult to believe that it was the first ever marathon organised by the group. Everything was carried out with

perfection and no problems were ever faced whatsoever, irrespective of both a runner's and

a volunteer's perception. Everyone knew exactly what they had to do, and it was carried

out very professionally. </li>
<li>It is a huge achievement to the organisers of the marathon, to have

conducted this very successful event - MADathon.</li><br>

<li>We thank each and every one of the volunteers for their small but crucial steps in organising

this flawless and extra-ordinary event.</li><br>

<li>This event not only pledged to bring out a smile in little children but also brought one to

everyone who was a part of the MADathon.</li>
